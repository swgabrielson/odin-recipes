    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A triple-meat blend is the secret to these always-moist, homemade, baked meatballs. These are the ultimate culinary multitaskers for carnivores.</p>
    <p>They can be small or big. They can be built upon beef, pork, chicken, turkey, lamb, or any combination thereof including fish. They can be stuffed or coated. They can be lavishly seasoned or simply salted. Then when it comes time to meet the heat, meatballs can be roasted, baked, simmered, sautéed, braised, fried, or grilled.</p>
    <p>I often make up big batches of these guys, bake ’em, cool and freeze ’em in muffin pans, then transfer to heavy-duty zip-top bags for storage. They’ll keep for up to six months and you can revive them simply by simmering for a few minutes in a pot of sauce or soup.</p>
