    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Satay is a Southeast Asian dish of seasoned, skewered and grilled meat, served with a sauce. 
        The earliest preparations of satay is believed to have originated in Java island, but has 
        spread to almost anywhere in Indonesia, where it has become a national dish. Indonesian 
        satay is often served with peanut sauce â€“ a sauce made from ground roasted peanuts, and is 
        often accompanied with lontong, a type of rice cake, though the diversity of the country has 
         produced a wide variety of satay recipes. It is also popular in many other Southeast Asian
          countries including Brunei, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. It is also 
          recognized and popular in Suriname and the Netherlands. In Sri Lanka, it has become a 
          staple of the local diet as a result of the influences from the local Malay community.
