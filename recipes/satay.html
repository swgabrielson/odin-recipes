    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Satay is a Southeast Asian dish of seasoned, skewered and grilled meat, served with a sauce. 
        The earliest preparations of satay is believed to have originated in Java island, but has 
        spread to almost anywhere in Indonesia, where it has become a national dish. Indonesian 
        satay is often served with peanut sauce â€“ a sauce made from ground roasted peanuts, and is 
        often accompanied with lontong, a type of rice cake, though the diversity of the country has 
         produced a wide variety of satay recipes. It is also popular in many other Southeast Asian
          countries including Brunei, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. It is also 
          recognized and popular in Suriname and the Netherlands. In Sri Lanka, it has become a 
          staple of the local diet as a result of the influences from the local Malay community.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, sliced 1/3 inch thick</li>
        <li>1 large lime, zested and juiced</li>
        <li>2 inch piece ginger, peeled and grated on rasp</li>
        <li>3 Thai bird chilis, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 cup kecap manis or Indonesian sweet soy sauce (easily found on the web)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons chili oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>pinch freshly grated nutmeg</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the chicken in a 1-gallon zip top bag. Thoroughly combine the remaining 
            ingredients in a medium bowl then add to the bag. Securely seal, squeezing out as much 
            air as possible. Squish the bag around to ensure everything is evenly coated, then 
            refrigerate for 2-3 hours.</li>
        <li>When the marinating time is almost up, prepare a charcoal grill for direct heat.</li>
        <li>Remove the chicken from the bag (reserving the marinade) and place on a rack positioned 
            over a sheet pan to catch any drips. Thread 1 or 2 slices of chicken per skewer so they 
            lay straight and flat. You should end up with around 20 skewers.</li>
        <li>Pour the reserved marinade into a 1-quart saucepan over medium-high heat and boil for 5
             minutes until thickened to glaze consistency.</li>
        <li>Arrange the skewers on the grill and cook, flipping them often and brushing with the 
            marinade, for 2-3 minutes, or until nicely charred and cooked through. Remove to a 
            platter.</li>
        <li>Serve as is, or with our Cashew Coconut Sauce for dipping.</li>
    </ol>
